# loPro

Lopro is a diminutive of Logical Properties. Lopro is a small PWA using and introducing logical properties with example of code and demonstration. Some of the properties including in Logical Properties are experimental, but you can still explore the concept. 
For some more fun, the PWA have some animation thanks to scroll-timeline which is also in experimental state. 
Have fun :)
